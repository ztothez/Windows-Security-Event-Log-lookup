<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>
This privacy policy applies to all browser extensions published by the developer.
</p>

<p>
The extensions do <strong>not collect, store, track, or share</strong> any personal or
identifiable user data.
</p>

<p>
All functionality is initiated explicitly by the user. When a user performs a lookup
(e.g. IP address, URL, file hash, or similar technical identifier), the selected value
may be sent directly to a relevant third-party public service (such as security or
reputation databases) solely to provide the requested result.
</p>

<p>
The extensions do not retain this data, do not log user activity, and do not use
analytics, tracking technologies, or persistent identifiers.
</p>

<p>
No data is transmitted to the developer or to any servers controlled by the developer.
</p>

<p>
If you have questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer via the
extension’s public repository or store listing.
